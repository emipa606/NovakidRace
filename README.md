this mod adds the novakid from starbound as a playable race and two factions.

features:
-unique head graphics
-unarmed attacks do burn damage instead of normal blunt
-novakids can endure extreme temperatures because they are made out of gas
-unique body and organs
-12 skin colors for novakids

to do list
-fix stuff with prep. carefully
-better icon for bandit camp, placeholder is kinda ugly
-add more brands ( head graphics )
-add custom backstories
-make a novakid scenario
-even more skin colours
-EPOE patch
-(items?)


this mod requires humanoid alien framework.

one known mod conflict: a novakid in the prep. carefully completely breaks it, so watch out for that

huge thanks to all admins, modmakers and users of the alien framework discord for helping me!
